# My Portfolio

This repository holds the files for a personal portfolio. The links in the nav bar direct the visitor to different sections on the page. The "Work" section showcases the projects I have made or hope to complete. These showcases also link to the live URLs for those projects. Besides the nav bar, every link opens in a new tab of the visitors browser. When viewed at different dimensions the content adjusts itself.
